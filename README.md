## Amhrán

Amhrán is a React-based website that showcases one Irish song every day/

I'm using react-router to have separate URLs for each track and archive.

You can run this on your own server with npm:

`npm install`

`npm start`

The track info is imported from tracks.json, which kinda automates the whole process of adding tracks to the site.
