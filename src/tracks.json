      "topDesc": "The Irish hip-hop scene has seen a resurgence lately, breaking into the mainstream with increasingly high festival-billings and a larger audience than ever.",
      "mainDesc": "But one artist stands out amongst the rest - Kojaque. I first discovered Kojaque through his viral hit \"Midnight Flower\", but it was with his 2018 project \"Deli Daydreams\" that he cemented himself in the scene as the most creative and talented hip-hop artist in the country. \"Deli Daydreams\" was one of my favourite projects of the year, and \"Date Night\" seems like the perfect follow-up. To me it nearly feels like a victory lap, with both Kojaque and Luka Palm dripping with confidence after their new-found success. Kojaque's flow is completely flawless, and sounds like an absolute pro. Luka Palm weaves in and around Kojaque throughout the track and is a great addition. Kean Kavanagh's production is great with a commanding bassline and a late switch-up, which Kojaque rides perfectly. With a track like this, I can't wait to see what Soft Boy Records come out with next."

Her sound isn't overly complicated and reminds me of the 90s/early 00s sound, but everything is executed really well. This track is a really catchy one, I always find it stuck in my head when I least expect. Sidenote: the amount of great music from the Derry/Donegal region is crazy."
